        <h2>Our Use of Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Any or all of the above Data may be required by us from time to time in order to provide you with the
                best possible service and experience when using our Website. Specifically, Data may be used by us for
                the following reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>internal record keeping;</li>
                    <li>improvement of our products / services;</li>
                    <li>transmission by email of marketing materials that may be of interest to you;</li>
                    <li>contact for market research purposes which may be done using email, telephone, fax or mail. Such
                        information may be used to customise or update the Website;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>We may use your Data for the above purposes if we deem it necessary to do so for our legitimate
                interests. If you are not satisfied with this, you have the right to object in certain circumstances
                (see the section headed "Your rights" below).</li>
            <li>For the delivery of direct marketing to you via e-mail, we'll need your consent, whether via an opt-in
                or soft-opt-in:
                <ul>
                    <li>soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies when you have previously engaged
                        with us (for example, you contact us to ask us for more details about a particular
                        product/service, and we are marketing similar products/services). Under "soft opt-in" consent,
                        we will take your consent as given unless you opt-out.</li>
                    <li>for other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent; that is, you
                        need to take positive and affirmative action when consenting by, for example, checking a tick
                        box that we'll provide.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>if you are not satisfied with our approach to marketing, you have the right to withdraw consent at any
                time. To find out how to withdraw your consent, see the section headed "Your rights" below.</li>
            <li>When you register with us and set up an account to receive our services, the legal basis for this
                processing is the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request, to
                enter into such a contract.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

                    systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to restrict our use of your Data</strong> - the right to "block" us from using your
                    Data or limit the way in which we can use it.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> - the right to request that we move, copy or transfer
                    your Data.</li>

                you may be able to refer your complaint to the relevant data protection authority. For the UK, this is
                the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The ICO's contact details can be found on their website at
                https://ico.org.uk/.</li>
            <li>It is important that the Data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your
                Data changes during the period for which we hold it.</li>
